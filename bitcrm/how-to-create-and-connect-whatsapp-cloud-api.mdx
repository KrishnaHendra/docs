# How to Create and Connect WhatsApp Cloud API

If you're ready to leverage the **WhatsApp Cloud API** to enhance your business communications, follow this comprehensive guide to integrate a number into your WhatsApp account. Ensure you review the **Requirements** section to facilitate a smooth setup process.

## Requirements Before You Begin

- **Verified Meta Business Manager**  
  Your business must be verified by Meta with legal documents.

- **Admin Access to Meta Business Manager**  
  You must have full control access in your Business Manager account.

- **A Clean & Unused Phone Number**

  - Not currently used on any WhatsApp (personal or business).
  - Capable of receiving SMS or phone calls for verification.
  - If your number is active on WhatsApp, you must delete the WhatsApp account first. For instructions, refer to steps 3-5 of this process.

- **Business Details Ready**
  - Business name, address, website or social media page, email.
  - Legal documents (NPWP, SIUP, or equivalent).

## Creating a Meta Business Manager (if you don't have one)

1. Visit [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com) and create a new Business Account.
2. Complete your business information and verify your email address.

⚠️ Ensure your Facebook account has **Full Control (Admin Access)** in Business Settings → People. This is required to continue the integration process.

### Verifying Your Business Manager

1. In Business Settings, navigate to **Security Center** → **Business Verification**.
2. Submit your legal business documents (e.g., NPWP, SIUP, or other equivalent documents as required).

⚠️ Business verification is mandatory to unlock full WhatsApp API access and use it for real customer messaging.

## Integration Process

### Step 3: Fill in Business Information

⚠️ This step is only necessary if you're creating a new Facebook Business Manager Account.

1. In the "Fill in your business information" section, click the "Business portfolio" dropdown and choose between:
   - Create a business portfolio and fill in details like "Business name," "Business email," "Business website or profile page," and "Country".
   - Or select an existing business portfolio from the dropdown, which will auto-fill the form.
2. Click "Next".

3. In the "Create or select your WhatsApp Business Account" section, click the "Create a WhatsApp Business Account" and “Create or Choose WhatsApp Business Profile” dropdown and choose between:
   - Choose "Create a WhatsApp Business Account" and in the next dropdown, "Create a new WhatsApp Business Profile."
   - Fill in "WhatsApp Business Account Name," "WhatsApp Business display name," and "Category". Then click “Next”.

⚠️ We recommend using the same "Display Name" as the branding on your website. [Check the Display name guidelines](https://www.facebook.com).

Or Select Existing Facebook Business Manager

- Or select an existing “WhatsApp Business account” and, in the "Create or choose WhatsApp Business Profile" dropdown, choose to "Create a new WhatsApp Business profile."

⚠️ Importance! You can create multiple profiles on your WhatsApp Business account.

### Step 4: Add a Phone Number for WhatsApp

Add the phone number that you will be connecting with bitbybit Studio. Please remember that this number can't be used simultaneously in WhatsApp business or the WhatsApp consumer app.

Or, get a free WhatsApp number: WhatsApp will generate a +1 555 number to use exclusively for sending messages. It cannot be used to start or receive calls or texts. No verification is required. This option will be available for selected accounts.

Once done, click "Next".

If the existing phone number is active on one of the WhatsApp apps, you'll need to delete it from the app. To do so, please follow steps 3-5 of this process.

5. Enter a phone number to receive the verification code in "Add a new or existing number."

1. Complete the process by clicking "Add payment method"

Please note: To unlock additional features and other advanced functionalities, you need to add a payment method.

- If you skip adding a payment method, your WhatsApp Cloud API will still be connected, but some features will be restricted like message templates and campaigns.

To fully activate your WhatsApp Cloud API and unlock all messaging features, you need to add a payment method in Meta Business Manager. Please follow the steps below carefully:

1. Go to Business Settings at [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com).

2. In the left sidebar, select Settings and click WhatsApp Accounts.

6. Fill in all Business Information as requested (name, legal entity, billing address, etc).
7. After saving, make sure there are no alerts or warnings on the payment settings page.

### Step 7: Test Your WhatsApp API

After setting up WhatsApp Cloud API including adding the payment method, send a test message, test it by sending a message using a Campaign, Automation, or Chat Initiation template. Follow these guides to create your template:

- Campaign: [Create Template Campaign](https://www.bitbybit.studio/knowledge-base/how-to-create-a-message-template-for-otp-whatsapp-cloud-api)
- Automation: [Create Template Automation](https://www.bitbybit.studio/knowledge-base/how-to-create-a-message-template-for-otp-whatsapp-cloud-api)
- Chat Initiation: [Create Template Chat Initiation](https://www.bitbybit.studio/knowledge-base/how-to-create-a-message-template-for-otp-whatsapp-cloud-api)

Note that Meta categorizes messages into conversation rate: Authentication, Marketing, Utility, Service. Check Meta’s pricing details here.

Once your template is created, test it in bitbybit’s LiveChat page to ensure it sends and receives successfully.

⚠️ If the message successfully delivers, your integration is 100% complete.
⚠️ If it fails, recheck the steps above, especially your payment status and phone number verification.

The message you sent should appear on the bitbybit Livechat page.
